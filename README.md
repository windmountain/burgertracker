# Burger Tracker

## An internal tool for running Bottomless Burgers

Bottomless Burgers is a thing in Los Angeles where you go to an existing burger restaurant at a specified time and pay $16 to have as many hamburgers, cheeseburgers, veggie burgers, fries and sodas as you want. Usually every other Tuesday night. Follow @bottomlessburgers on Instagram to catch the next one.

This app helps us track orders and lets us know if were making a few dollars or losing a few dollars.
