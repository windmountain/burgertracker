backlog:

  special analytics log capturing intent
  not counting comped users as revenue or expense
  undo

ugh:

  adjust sales tax -- difficult, feedback loop with input and */ 100
  mobile view -- hard because elm-reactor/elm-html don't deal with anything outside <body>

unprioritized:

  form labels
  menu item validation
  user validation
  "cancel" a guest (no revenue, no new requests, cancel unordered items)
  add memos to requests ("no tomato")
  remove "open orders"
  identify sharks and whales
  print git hash on top of page (or in footer?)
  soda flavors as high-level concept?
  sort requests by type, reduce to counts of identical
  per-guest as pop up (or non-repeating)
  

done:
  memo field
  delete menuItem
  add menu item
  delete request
