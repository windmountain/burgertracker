backlog:

  special analytics log capturing intent
  sort requests by type, reduce to counts of identical items
    - how does this work at Fuddruckers where cheese is a separate lineitem?
    - ideal output: [ Guthrie burger no onions, Guthrie cheese, Tony burger, Tony cheese, Guthrie soda, Tony soda ]
    - implies that cheese is a special type
  undo
    - how does this work analytics log?
  guest-centric memos, working towards a "guest profile"

ugh:

  mobile view -- hard because elm-reactor/elm-html don't deal with anything outside <body>

unprioritized:
  form labels
  menu item validation
  user validation
  "cancel" a guest (no revenue, no new requests, cancel unordered items)
  identify sharks and whales
  print git hash on top of page (or in footer?)
  soda flavors as high-level concept?
  per-guest as pop up (or non-repeating)

done:
  remove "open orders"
  not counting comped users as revenue ~or expense~ (postponing expense)
  adjust sales tax -- difficult, feedback loop with input and */ 100
  memo field
  delete menuItem
  add menu item
  delete request

wontfix:
  add memos to requests ("no tomato") (memos belong on user above all else)
